		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item \textbf{FPGA Acceleration of Secure Function Evaluation.} We designed two accelerators for the SFE protocol named Yao's Garbled Circuit (GC): one accelerates any generic function, and the other is customized for deep learning applications. They are respectively 100 and 672 times faster than the previous generic accelerator. 
				\item \textbf{Circuit Compilation for Yao's GC.} We designed synthesis libraries and optimization strategies for industrial logic synthesis tools to compile circuits optimized for the GC protocol. Our method reduces the cost by up to 84$\%$ compared to existing GC compilers in all the reported benchmarks. 
				\item \textbf{Secure Location Based Services.} (i) Localization of Smart Cars, (ii) Scalable $k$-Nearest Neighbor Search.
				\item \textbf{On-chip Test of True Random Number Generators and Physical Unclonable Functions.} We implemented seven tests from the NIST test suit along with a Built-In-Self-Test scheme on FPGA for on-chip evaluation. 
				\item \textbf{Secure Hamming Distance for Authentication of Intrinsic Physical Unclonable Functions.}
